These are some simple functions for working with an hd44780 compatible
display. The code supports a mode where the eight data pins are
connected to a shift register, and thus the display only requires four
pins from the AVR. Tested with the ATmega88 and the 8-pin ATtiny13A.

I could not find something similar from a quick check, so I thought
I'd share. Do what you wish with the stuff.
